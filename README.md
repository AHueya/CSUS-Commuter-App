# About
Computer Software Engineering (CSC-131) project for CSUS UTAPS.

The FMZ Commuter App is a website based app that is intended to help Sac State commuters and visitors determine the best means of transportation when considering money, time, and sustainability.


## Function
The FMZ Commuter App is designed to provide Sac State commuters and vistors with an easy to use guide that will help them make informed decisions about their commute as well as recommendations for alternative transportation.

### Functional Requirements
Listed below are the functional requirements of our design:
- Accessible to anyone visiting
- Ranked priorities from a given list
- Survey
- Give best option based on individual’s needs
- Provides information for transportation methods
- Data collection
- Color scheme should be in line with CSUS websites’

### Algorithm 
The calculation for the top 3 choices is performed by a point system where every possible commuting option is given a point value depending on the ranking priority of time, money, and sustainability as well as some of the survey options. 

A majority of the points are awarded during the ranking of our three categories: time, money, and sustainability. The point system for this section will be a ranked style system where the commuting option that best fits the category will received the max points of an 8 and the following commuting options will received points in descending order (e.g. 7, 6, 5, etc.). Additionally, depending on the ranking of the category, the points will receive a multiplier to add weight to our category ranking system.
